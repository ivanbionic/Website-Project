        <p>I graduated Seattle University in 2019 with a degree in Theatre. I primarily studied and practiced acting, while also learning how to engineer and build sets. I pursued this career because it was enriching, exciting, and different--at least it was for me. When the world shut down for COVID-19, I wasn't able to pursue my dream anymore. The show I was in closed. Any prospects either failed to start or became a zoom play, which I didn't ever want to do again. So I worked seemingly normal jobs since then. I had a short stint in a sandwich shop, then I worked at <em>Organized Spaces</em> for ten months. I built closets for $20/hr. I would go to wealthy peoples' houses and rebuild their dream spaces. I would be exposed to how the other side of the working world is able to live. The white-collar world.</p>
